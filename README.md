Dashing Widgets
===============

A collection of Dashing widgets that we use in our internal dashboards.

The TeamCity widget is heavily based on [Zendesk's TravisCI widget](https://github.com/zendesk/dashing_travisci), which we also use.

The Github Milestones widget is an adaption of [Jason Walton's milestones widget](https://gist.github.com/jwalton/6499159) made to work with multiple projects.
